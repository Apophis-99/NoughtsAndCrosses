# Noughts & Crosses
A simple Noughts And Crosses Console Application written in C#. \
It allows for 0, 1 or 2 players. \
The AI can make winning moves and attempt to intervene when a player is about to win. \
It will eventually be able to base its moves off past game data (this is currently a work in progress).
